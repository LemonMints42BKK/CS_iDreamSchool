    "A big part of why computers are so powerful is that they can repeat many actions or calculation very quickly. One of the ways we can tell a computer to do this is through loops. A loop is a special kind of programming statement that allows you to repeat a block of code. Like all programming languages, Python has two kinds of main loops: **for loops** and **while loops**."

This kind of loop also repeats a block of code over and over, but it will keep repeating as long as a Boolean expression continues to be **True** to the computer. We also use this type of loop with groups of items just like in **for** loops. However, the **while** loop is very different than a **for** loop, because we tend to use the **while** loop when we don't know how many times we need to repeat a block of code.
